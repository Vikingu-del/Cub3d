## Description:

Explore the world of 3D graphics with cub3D, a C-based project inspired by the iconic Wolfenstein 3D game. Developed by John Carmack and John Romero, Wolfenstein 3D marked the inception of "First Person Shooters" in 1992. In this project, you'll implement a realistic 3D graphical representation of a maze using Ray-Casting principles.

## Key Features:

Realistic first-person perspective in a maze.
Smooth window management and user-friendly navigation controls.
Display of different wall textures based on the maze's orientation.
Set floor and ceiling colors dynamically.
Input handling for arrow keys and WASD keys for movement.
Scene description file parsing with specific rules.
